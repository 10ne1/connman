Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

Core
====

- connman_element removal

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C8
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- Session API implementation

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Daniel Wagner <daniel.wagner@bmw-carit.de>
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   The session API should provide a connection abstraction in order to
   prioritize applications network accesses, prevent or allow network
   and bearer roaming, or provide applications with a way to request
   for periodic network connections. On-demand connections will be
   implemented through this API as well.

- Provisioning D-Bus API

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Henri Bragge <henri.bragge@ixonos.com>

   The current service provisioning lacks a D-Bus interface for modifying
   existing configurations.


- WiSPR support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>

   Based on the portal detection parsing results, and provisioned
   credentials, ConnMan should be able to initiate a WiSPR authentication.


WiFi
====

- Ad-Hoc support

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Dependencies: Core:IPv4LL
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- Fast Connect

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>


- EAP-AKA/SIM

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   This EAP is needed for SIM card based network authentication.
   ConnMan here plays a minor role: Once wpa_supplicant is set up for
   starting and EAP-AKA/SIM authentication, it will talk to a SIM card
   through its pcsc-lite API.


- EAP-FAST

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1
   Owner: Henri Bragge <henri.bragge@ixonos.com>


- EAP-GTC

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1
   Owner: Henri Bragge <henri.bragge@ixonos.com>


- WiFi p2p

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C2


- DUN server

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4
   Owner: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

   For DUN server support, ConnMan needs to provide an API for oFono
   to trigger IP forwarding on a point to point interface. An IP range
   should also be reserved.



Bluetooth
=========

- DUN client

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C4


VPN

- l2tp support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Mohamed Abbas <mohamed.abbas@intel.com>


- pptp support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2
   Owner: Mohamed Abbas <mohamed.abbas@intel.com>
