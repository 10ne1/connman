  o Support for WPA/WPA2 Enterprise WiFi authentication

	With wpa_supplicant the support for WPA/WPA2 Enterprise is already
	present, but it needs properly hooked up. This involves a correct
	security architecture since it uses personalized credentials.

  o Support for multiple profiles

	Currently only one active profile (the default profile) is supported.

  o Support for static IPv4 configuration

	This is in theory possible, but no D-Bus API has been defined on how
	to configure it.
