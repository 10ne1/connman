Properties	string State [readonly]

			The global connection state of a system. Possible
			values are "online" if at least one connection exists
			and "offline" if no device is connected.

			In certain situations the state might change to
			the value "connected". This can only be seen if
			previously no connection was present.

		string Policy [readwrite]

			The global connection policy of a system. This
			allows to configure how connections are established
			and also when they are taken down again.

			Possible values are "single", "multiple" and "ask".

			For the single policy, the priority setting of the
			device defines which becomes the default connection
			when multiple are available.

		boolean OfflineMode [readwrite]

			The offline mode indicates the global setting for
			switching all radios on or off. Changing offline mode
			to true results in powering down all devices. When
			leaving offline mode the individual policy of each
			device decides to switch the radio back on or not.

			During offline mode, it is still possible to switch
			certain technologies manually back on. For example
			the limited usage of WiFi or Bluetooth devices might
			be allowed in some situations.
