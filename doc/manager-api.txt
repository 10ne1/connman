Signals		InterfaceAdded(object)

Method: ListInferfaces
======================
This method lists all available interfaces. The return value is an array of
object paths. Every attached network interface (eth0, wlan0 etc.) of the
system is presented by an object path with additional interfaces on it. The
main interface is org.freedesktop.connman.Interface.

Method: RegisterAgent
=====================
This method allows the user interace to register an agent. There can be only
one agent registered at a time. The parameter of the method is the object
path the agent has been registered for the callback method. The agent has
to implement org.freedesktop.connman.Agent interface on this object path.

Method: UnregisterAgent
=======================
This method unregisters a previously registered agent. In case the agent
application exits the core will automatically unregister the agent. However
for a clean agent application it is important to call the unregister method.

Signal: InterfaceAdded
======================
This signal is emitted every time a new interface has been found by the
core and successfully activated. The signal is also emitted on startup
or at anytime at runtime in case of hotplug devices.

Signal: InterfaceRemoved
========================
This signal is emitted every time an interface has been removed. This can
happen at any time in case of hotplug devices. When the system shuts down,
this signal is also emitted.
