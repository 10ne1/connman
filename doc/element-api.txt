Method: GetProperties
=====================
This method allows to retrieve all properties of an element at once. The
properties are presented in a dictionary.

Property: Type
==============
This property represents the main type of an element. It can have the values
like "device", "network", "ipv4", "ipv6", "dhcp", "bootp" and "zeroconf".

Property: Subtype
=================
This property represents the subtype of an element. In the normal case this
is the hardware type. It can have values like "ethernet", "wifi", "wimax",
"modem" and "bluetooth".

The element system will inherit the subtype from the parent if not overwritten
manually and so it should be present in every element.

Property: Driver
================
This property represents the driver that is assigned to this element. This
value will only be present in case of Device elements. On Linux system this
is the kernel driver name.

Property: Vendor
================
This property represent the vendor string for this element. This value is only
present in case of a Device element. This information are taken from HAL.

Property: Product
=================
This property represent the product string for this element. This value is only
present in case of a Device element. This information are taken from HAL.
